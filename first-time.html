            <p>
                If you are in Colorado or Wyoming, this is the perfect place for you to come skydive. We are located just outside of Greeley Colorado, not to far from Cheyenne, Fort Collins, Windsor, Longmont, Boulder, or Denver. If you come do a tandem jump with us you will have anazing views of the Rocky Mountains, and the endless plains to the east.

            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>
                You dont have to have a license to enjoy falling from the sky, after just 10 minutes of ground instruction you will be ready to skydive with one of our experienced tandem instructors. After a beautiful plane ride of about XXX minutes, going up to XXXXXX feet agl, your tandem instructor will strap you on and you will exit the aircraft and fall at about XXXX miles per hour! After free-fall, your tandem instructor will deploy a specially designed parachute and you will spend the rest of the jump floating safely to the ground.
