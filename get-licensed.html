            <h2>Static Line Training</h2>						
            <p>
                Static line training is your first step towards becoming a licensed skydiver. The solo first-jump course lasts all day and consists of in class instruction and skill development, a tandem jump, and a solo jump. The course starts on Saturday morning at 8am with a tandem jump followed by the in-class session. Once you have completed the classroom session, you will be ready to make your first jump under the guidance of a licensed static line instructor!

                We believe that the best way to learn to skydive and become comfortable in the air is to start from the ground up. You will initially do a tandem jump where you will learn what it feels like to freefall, deploy a parachute, and become familiar with the controls. After that you will do your first static line jump solo from 3,500ft above the ground, you will not be connected to an instructor. Your parachute will be automatically deployed immediately upon existing the aircraft. The training will be focused on stable body position on exit, canopy flight, and proper landing techniques. Once you are under canopy, an instructor on the ground will guide your flight pattern and landing using a radio. A major benefit to the static line course compared to the advanced free fall program (AFF) offered at other dropzones is that you learn more canopy skills first!
