            <h2>Static Line Training</h2>						
            <p>
                Static line training is your first step towards becoming a licensed skydiver. The solo first-jump course lasts around 7 hours and consists of in class instruction and skill development. The course starts on Saturday morning at 9am and finishes around 1pm. Once you have completed the classroom session, you will be ready to make your first jump under the guidance of a licensed static line instructor.

            <p>
                We believe that the best way to learn to skydive and become comfortable in the air is to start from the ground up. After your classroom training you will do your first static line jump solo from 3,500ft above the ground, you will not be connected to an instructor. Your parachute will be automatically deployed immediately upon existing the aircraft. The training will be focused on stable body position on exit, canopy flight, and proper landing techniques. Once you are under canopy, an instructor on the ground will guide your flight pattern and landing using a radio. A major benefit to the static line course compared to the advanced free fall program (AFF) offered at other dropzones is that you learn more canopy skills first, prior to jumping from full altitude, so by the time you are jumping with multiple other jumpers you have the knowledge and experience needed to avoid other skydivers under canopy.

            <h3>Static Line Jump Progression</h3>
            <p>
                During the static-line training you will complete 25 jumps. The first 5 jumps will be static-line jumps. The rest will be freefall jumps of gradually increasing altitude where you are responsible for pulling your own parachute.
